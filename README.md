# chorale-management-App


This project showcases my involvement in developing the backend application for a chorale management system using Node.js and Express.js. Within this framework, I'm responsible for various tasks such as email dispatching, CRUD operations, email verification, registration confirmation, and real-time notification management utilizing Socket.IO. Additionally, I handle cron job tasks for scheduled operations.
